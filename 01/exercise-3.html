    <h3 style="text-align: right;">Description</h3>
    <p><b>Red pandas</b> can be easily identified by their unique ruddy coat color, which acts like camouflage within the canopy of fir trees where branches are covered with clumps of reddish-brown moss and white lichens. They have large, round heads and short snouts with big, pointed ears. Their faces are white with reddish-brown “tear” marks that extend from the eyes to the corner of the mouth. These markings could have evolved to help keep the sun out of their eyes. Their tails are marked with alternating red and buff rings.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: right;"><i>Habitat</i></h3>
    <p style="color: crimson;"><u>Red pandas live in high-altitude,</u>temperate forests with bamboo understories in the Himalayas and other high mountains. They range from northern Myanmar (Burma) to the west Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces of China. They are also found in suitable habitat in Nepal, India and Tibet. Ailurus fulgens fulgens lives predominantly in Nepal and can also be found in India and Bhutan. <sub>Ailurus fulgens styani (or Ailurus fulgens refulgens) is primarily found in China and Myanmar.</sub></p>
